Bitcoin needs to slay monsters

Even bitcoiners don’t value hard money enough (yet)

Bitcoiners love to talk about hard money and how bitcoin will change the world. They even claim to fix the world, by fixing “the money”.

Yet many talk the talk, but don’t make the efforts, nor sacrifices.
Walking the walk, is usually no further than the nearest bitcoin meetup, or the occasional trip to a tax-haven.

Other than that. They’re chained to their fiat-past. Their kids, their house, their hobbies, their spouse and job.

They serve the local bank branch (beg them to have a bit of their own money like everyone else), they watch TV, hold bitcoin and have this mindset where they truly think that bitcoin will grow, despite them doing jack all. They think they can reap the benefits in silence, while others do the heavy lifting, they smirk.
They delude themselves however, thinking their sly passive stance is a risk-free act of brilliance.

However, they’re scared, and have bitcoin in a fiat cage.
Their existence is just a wallet waiting to be drained by force or pressure. By the same monstrous forces that keep our heads down.

Whether discussing its digital scarcity or its fiat price, the focus invariably circles back to Bitcoin as a driver for a product or service.
Do you want bitcoin, do you like bitcoin? Want to work with bitcoin? Here’s a service or wallet you can buy for a few hundred dollars, here’s my link. Want to participate in the network?
Buy our pre-made and plug-and-play “solution”? Want to know more, or do you know wealthy people that want in” “Call me…”
They’re selling.

Don’t get me wrong,
I also believe bitcoin is changing that world right now.
And earning a living is good, be it with art, writing, selling a service or moving a box from A to B.
But they don’t get it. Because it’s damned near impossible to escape the cage

Disproof Escapism

The bitcoin genie is out of the bottle. We DO have digitally scarce, hard money!

The core of the message most bitcoiners promote (including the author of this article) revolves around the prevalent “debt-and-war” fiat system and the harm it inflicts on society in general. Bitcoiners explain how it enslaves us, impoverishes us, and fosters a short-term perspective, empty consumerism, and a disregard for skills, all while leaving entire generations in debt and modern forms of servitude.

That reality alone will change many mechanisms within society. That should be the core of bitcoiners and their way of living. Not promoting a referral link to get a few sats or putting a sticker on a bathroom wall at a bar. We discuss open source theories and personality traits, not how to win the race. We don’t scheme, infiltrate or sabotage; we step onto the stage humbly, like nervous kids reciting poetry for a king. We only face our own audiences. Not the audience of followers of the monsters. We might as well do a leaflet campaign in the desert while we’re at it.

We often hear terms like "sound money" and the assertion "there's no second best," with some even calling it "digital gold." This latter term is particularly misleading. Gold, despite its past significance, was subject to confiscation, serving the ambitions of nations and the wealthy. Bitcoin, in contrast, is not simply a digital iteration of gold; that label is a fiat construct that fails to capture its distinct nature.

However, the question remains: why is it that, when push comes to shove, we as Bitcoiners don’t truly live, think, and breathe this “thing” called Bitcoin as the hardest money in existence?
Because we don’t.
I’ve visited a fair share of meetups and conferences (though not many, as conferences are largely a sham anyway) to observe the ethos in practice. And it’s not always a pretty sight.

Assholes and grifters remain assholes and grifters, regardless of whether they hold BTC or not.

Thinking in fiat terms is still rampant (including for myself, by the way, to some extent). We were born into fiat, shaped by fiat, and have worked, traded, saved, and lost within its confines.

The fiat mindset, I dare say, is even more detrimental when Bitcoiners adopt it, as it amplifies the negative consequences even beyond those of the fiat world itself.

After all, at the very least, those within the fiat system are all equally screwed in their flawed monetary reality by a system that is a true circus Maximus of greed and debt.
Consider those burdened by immense student loan debt, individuals with unrecognized talent, and others denied opportunities because less skilled people from higher financial echelons secure “proof of stake” jobs.
Even if they lack the necessary abilities. There are fiat denizens sent to war, subjected to bombings, and relentlessly exploited for profit throughout their lives to sustain a parasitic, rent-seeking system… all under the false promise of security in their later years… when in reality, they are chewed up and spit out.

When these fiat slaves wield a fiat mentality toward one another, it’s considered normal; no one can bat an eye if one fiat rent-seeker bleeds another dry, then tosses them aside for a new victim once the yield or short-term gain is realized. That’s simply how the fiat hamster wheel has been turning generations on end, while the proof-of-stake lords benefit across multiple generations.

The exploitation, the focus on short-term gains, the inherent stupidity of the system—it’s ingrained in the people themselves. Their greed and fiat/shitcoin mentality is "the norm." Some even dare to call it "capitalism" or democracy.

They can’t be offended by anyone screwing them over or getting ahead to gain a few fiat tokens, be it dollars or the Euro Mickey Mouse coin. They just carry on, shrug their shoulders, and crawl over each other like the basket full of crabs they inhabit day to day. Being among the few crabs that can touch the rim of the basket before being pulled down again by the other crabs, is what’s called success.

However, witnessing such behaviors and ways of living among individuals who identify as Bitcoiners evokes not only profound ethical sadness but also reveals consequences far more damaging to Bitcoin than if those same individuals had remained solely within the fiat system. Therefore, a fiat mentality within the Bitcoin space is even more repugnant than the mindset of some shitcoiners.
At least with shitcoiners, you understand they are peddling a token, coin, or some fabricated service to offload onto unsuspecting individuals to make ends meet (and fund their cheap hotel rooms in exotic looking places while projecting an image of success (and the Modern Ottoman beard look) on Instagram). Consider a scenario: if someone at a vegetable market (assuming such places still exist in the fiat world) suggests to another vendor a way to conduct more business off the books, it’s met with indifference. That’s considered normal.

But when a Bitcoiner at a meetup — an event where for three years you've been trying to dissociate Bitcoin from the tired narrative of it being solely "for fraudsters and criminals" — and you overhear "Bitcoiners" discussing methods for laundering illicit funds, then it becomes a significant problem. As if they can’t make ends meet without doing “the fiat thing”.
Such individuals, as a Bitcoiner, disgust me. They clearly "don't get it." They fail to grasp the fundamental values of Bitcoin. They resemble the stereotypical used car salesmen who prioritize nothing beyond their immediate needs, like avoiding having to have a cheap dinner of dog food and tomato sauce that evening if they bag another customer by whatever lies they’ll have to tell. I would go so far as to assert that Bitcoiners with a fiat mentality are more detrimental to Bitcoin's growth than both those enslaved by the fiat system and shitcoiners themselves. A fiat drone will simply save, invest, and adhere to the established rules of banks and central banks.

They don’t question these norms; it’s their accepted reality. They’re labeled “normies” for a reason—they find satisfaction in conforming, believing the deception and theft, even perceiving it as beneficial because that’s what they’ve been told on television. They place their trust in numbers and statistics while diligently paying off their mortgages and investing in whatever financial products the TV shows spoon-feed them.
Shitcoiners (closely related to fiat slaves) will merely promote their scams and worthless projects to generate short-term gains (in fiat, naturally) to sustain their shallow lifestyles of loneliness, prostitutes, and grocery bills paid with bank cards from the Seychelles.

But Bitcoiners with a fiat mentality? They actively undermine Bitcoin. They are toxic, and the sooner they revert to pure fiat, the better for the Bitcoin ecosystem. They offer no positive contribution whatsoever to Bitcoin’s progress.

More bitcoiners need to grow a spine

I've started to label these individuals as “cosplay bitcoiners.” They are typically nothing more than bitcoin holders (definitely not HODLers).
These are people who act as though Bitcoin is merely another speculative asset (alongside a plethora of garbage coins and scams) instead of the monetary revolution it truly embodies. Most bitcoiners engage in this cosplay, reciting the talking points without actually changing their lives.

Or… they view it simply as a means to generate income by uttering the right phrases and selling various items and merchandise. If Bitcoin were to cease to exist (a highly improbable scenario), they would likely be selling counterfeit Pokémon merchandise, fake Rolexes, or working as box movers in retail (sporting a perm). This might upset some who have dedicated significant portions of their lives to the Bitcoin ecosystem. However, what should be far more infuriating is the realization that your dreams, hope, and hard work are ultimately benefiting these cosplayers.

These individuals also say things like “You could consider moving to Solana for a while…” or “I have a referral link for insert flavor-of-the-week scam.” This genuine effort to cultivate a Bitcoin ethos is often undermined by people lacking activism, backbone, or conviction. Typically, these are the same individuals who inquire about price action during minor dips in Bitcoin's fiat value. They exhibit “scared money” behavior, just like in the fiat world. Consider that: they are scared (of) money. That’s right,… people that lived, and were raised in fiat are in fact scared… of money. This ingrained perspective, though varying in its impact, can act as a distraction or even a negative influence on Bitcoin's overall growth. I know the genuine contributors are out there.
Rest assured, I am acutely aware of what it means to dedicate your time and energy to the betterment of Bitcoin; I've done it before and continue to do so years later. I respect that immensely. But the moment you recognize your efforts are primarily benefiting these parasites, you should immediately cease and let them wither.

They are not there for Bitcoin at all. I believe a fundamental aspect of being a Bitcoiner is calling out such behavior — to embody a form of activism, a vetting process aimed at fostering greater freedom. This might seem paradoxical, but it’s not; it’s akin to broadcasting a double-spent transaction onto mempool and having it rejected by the nodes. In my opinion, Bitcoin's primary essence is freedom. This freedom is underpinned by consensus and proof of work. However, this doesn't imply that we should be a universally accommodating resource for individuals who merely hold Bitcoin and seek to profit off our efforts while contributing nothing of substance to the space beyond their own marketing nonsense. They say the lines, but don’t save lives.

But why not?
If Bitcoin is truly the hardest money, the scarcest asset humanity has ever encountered, then why would we willingly trade it for a demonstrably inferior, inflationary, and state-controlled currency? This holds true even if that fiat is disguised as a modern "coin" or a cheap imitation of Bitcoin.

The uncomfortable truth is that many Bitcoiners, whether consciously or subconsciously, remain tethered to the legacy financial system. We espouse the principle of "don't trust, verify," yet we often evaluate Bitcoin through the distorted lens of its fiat exchange rate. Furthermore, many local meetups are infiltrated by individuals whose motives, schemes, and outright nonsense we fail to scrutinize or verify.

We neglect even the most fundamental forms of verification (such as accepting a function purported to be around 40 KB in data size when it's bundled within a > 50 MB software program). We profess belief in absolute scarcity, yet we shy away from adopting Bitcoin as our genuine unit of account, nor do we accurately measure our purchasing power (as devising a truly precise method might necessitate an invention worthy of a Nobel Prize in Economics).

Armed with the hardest money, ample liquidity, and considerable intellect, we still find ourselves waiting for Presidents, Philosophers, and various Personalities to artificially inflate Bitcoin's price, behaving like apprehensive investors in a newly listed startup.


“But with bitcoin”
These Philosophers, Personalities, and Presidents (PPPs) often represent a mere "follow-the-leader" phenomenon among many who identify as Bitcoiners. Philosophers delve into the intricacies of Bitcoin: its support for local social structures, its international applications, the underlying mathematics, the time-based mechanisms…

It's all incredibly fascinating and has been explained countless times in various tones and for diverse audiences. Yet, much like in Bitcoin software development, there's often a lack of curation or editing; people simply produce without rigorous testing or questioning the necessity or widespread adoption of their contributions.
Some even mistakenly believe these philosophers will somehow influence the "price." However, their role is primarily to explain, analyze, and provide understanding. That, of course, is valuable as it stimulates thought (even this very writing serves that purpose). However, Bitcoiners deeply entrenched in the philosophical aspects can often be blind to their own contradictory circumstances.

It can be jarring, even alienating, to listen to a podcast dissecting the profound intricacies of time and Bitcoin's blockchain while simultaneously enduring the mundane reality of your fiat job, with a coworker loudly handling customer calls nearby. The core issue is that this mentality increasingly mirrors the practices of the fiat (and shitcoin) world: passively holding onto "your bag" or "your stake" and promoting that position while vaguely advising others that "education is important" or "spreading the word is good."
Ultimately, many of those dispensing this advice do little more than appear on their YouTube channels, take the stage at their own conferences, or write (or commission) their paid newsletters.
Some diligently court wealthy individuals to explain Bitcoin, aiming to earn a few dollars, but they might as well be selling Tupperware if it paid the bills. Genuine care is often absent; it's their Bitcoin-flavored version of a fiat job. They are simply holding onto sats, much like one would hold onto ETFs or stocks in the traditional financial world. Michael Saylor, at a conference in Madeira, once stated: “You are here because Bitcoin needs you… and when you leave, I sincerely hope you will go out there and do good for Bitcoin.”

That's a commendable call to action. However, it also inadvertently highlights a form of servitude, a call that, regrettably, many have not heeded. Right now, Bitcoin's treated more like digital real estate than actual cash – something to hodl and hope it moons, while others do the promoting. Activism, at least here in Belgium, is a ghost town.

Elsewhere, it's often just small-time stuff, easily corrupted by book-writers, shitcoin promoters, ego-trippers, or even creeps hitting on vulnerable women in new-age scenes. This passive vibe has helped a bit, sure, but it shows we're still scared to call Bitcoin real money. It's the hardest money ever, yet we act like fiat's the boss, when Bitcoin's the true store of value. The circular economy crawls along. Instead of waiting for "hyperbitcoinization," we need to act like it's already here: support Bitcoin-only businesses, demand salaries in sats, and actually think in sats, not fiat. But become organized, more to the point: set up systems so you can build and rely on one another.

To make Bitcoin truly hard money, we gotta stop pricing it and thinking in fiat, actually use it to pay and get paid, teach people it's a monetary system not just an investment, and directly challenge fiat by building Bitcoin-native economies, not just begging institutions to buy in. The more we act like Bitcoin is money, the faster the world will have to agree.


Bitcoin’s success is not inevitable.
Because it is maintained by people, and people are inherently flawed. However, it is also governed by mathematics, a perfect framework that categorizes chaos into order and back into incomprehensible chaos. There, within the crucible of math, language, cryptography, and time, lies Bitcoin: our creation, our potential salvation, and perhaps our sole remaining hope.

It demands action from Bitcoiners. If we genuinely believe in Bitcoin as the hardest money, we must begin to utilize it as such, rather than posturing on stages like immature, attention-seeking individuals vying for personal recognition and petty power struggles.

The future is not forged by those idly waiting for a magical price point; it is built by those who actively transact, develop, work, and live on Bitcoin today. Hard money transcends mere scarcity; it embodies utility, intrinsic value, and the tangible construction of liberty. Bitcoin's purpose is not simply to replace the existing decay of fiat with a superficial rebranding of the same fundamental rot. Bitcoin is not intended to supplant the old fiat corruption with an identical corruption merely bearing a Bitcoin label or logo.

The divergence is stark: one grey-colored path leads us to a state of ambiguity and ineffectiveness, the other to a vibrant, focused purpose. This ambiguity manifests as excessive accommodation, an unwarranted stubbornness where adaptability is needed. We tend towards being overly compliant and even subservient, exhibiting exaggerated politeness and empathy, even as our advancements inevitably dismantle the obsolete systems. That path has a Dixie orange color.

This is because many Bitcoiners now crave external validation, leading to inconsistent and muddled messaging, belonging authentically to neither the stagnant grey nor the purposeful orange.

We, and our true Bitcoiners—our intellectual offspring—represent an inherently incompatible lineage, incapable of either peaceful coexistence ("protest") or productive integration ("procreate") with these outdated methodologies and their swarm of futile endeavors. The cosplay bitcoiners and their lukewarm followers and creations aspire to be part of a fintech reality that is not their own, and a fiat world that has relegated them to the roles of insignificant footnotes and background commentators.

Despite our core differences, we persist in engaging with the stake-people, the frail-minded powerhouses that let us participate in their arenas, gathering under the harsh glare of moral decay and corruption.
We mine Bitcoin from the future, but it’s tethered to the present. They hamper our progress with outdated tools and (re)distribution systems rooted in the 18th century.
We can invent so much better systems, bulldoze the old and rebuild our cities and reclaim our value.

It’s time…
The moment has arrived to begin valuing Bitcoin for what it has always been destined to be and will forever remain: hard money. Let us consign the parasites to their rightful place – the gutter of fiat. Reader, dear reader, you who have invested the time and effort to cease scrolling through the endless torrent of filth, garbage, and attention-seeking displays on your phone, do you grasp the unique historical opportunity presented to your vulnerable digital soul to reclaim your life, to transcend mere survival and truly flourish? Do you comprehend this? Do you even realize that digitally scarce, digitally verifiable hard money awaits your mining, purchase, holding, and personal safekeeping? Or do you still cling to the illusions projected onto the wall of Plato's cave, telling you every lie under the sun for their short gains and diatribes? Do you live in the corridor of greyness? Probably.

Observing the vapid semantic debates onstage, the performative security measures, and the blatant power struggles, I am reminded of the early Christian disciples and the challenges they must have faced in spreading the word of their Lord, relying solely on their individual conviction while constantly encountering those driven purely by the pursuit of power. Bitcoiners are no different, despite never having known their own guiding figures. The distinction lies in our approach: we do not expel the transgressors and the disreputable from the market; nor do we seek to cure the afflicted or nourish the starving. We are not torn apart by lions, for we operate in the shadows, our influence primarily through written works, lacking the support that stems from personal charisma. Fiat bleeds people dry, fueling the vile machinery of passive rent-seeking yield and perpetual servitude.

In Bitcoin, we possess the potential to be their undoing, but only if we can match their ruthlessness, their multi-generational cunning, and their inherent malice. That’s not in our nature, so we’ll need to change and adapt. To truly prevail, we must outmaneuver their evil, win their long-term game. To win, we must out-evil evil.
Win their multi-generational ongoing long-term game.
That’s not easy, because you’re being poisoned day in day out.

So… here goes.
You must choose your path: gray or orange.
Decide how you’ll navigate the clutter:
hardware wallets you don’t need,
unscalable orange-pilling that’s more about ego than Bitcoin,
books that hardly anyone reads,
redundant artwork you’ll never buy,
searching for a place in the unreachable oasis of bitcoin jobs, the mirage of funding,
the naïveté of Value4Value, the Saylor-worshipping instinct,
stickers slapped on poles,
rushed and untested software, apps that repel users,
conference circuses filled with grifters, posers and some half-gods,
The pump-my-bags philosophers.

The fork in the road lies ahead


Will you keep micro-dosing the corruption of the fiat world, day by day?
Or will you don your armor and sacrifice for future generations?
You ‘ll be part of an army of cyber Jesuït knights, or part of a gang of ad hoc grifters smelling like patchouli and fear.

Let centuries of hate and destruction be channeled like unbreakable equations, their tax collecting vultures, their redistribution to the weak.
We can be in harnesses, economically cause their bellies gorged on our produce, sliced virtually apart, ending their predatory exploitation and theater politics.

Let that hate flow block by block,
so our wait for a revolution, promised peace, and security, finally ends.
We don’t need to wait,
We have all we need - right - friggin - now!
All we need is here to start as the first generation of the ones that turn the table.
We can strike from here onwards.

You can’t do that just by standing there, we need to rally behind something.

So … we need to…


Slay the Monsters ( A Bitcoin manifesto )

The race against fiat’s totalitarian grip isn’t coming — it’s already here.

And we’re late.

We’re not facing some bureaucratic mess or sleepy institution.
We’re facing monsters.
Real monsters.
The kind that don’t blink, don’t break, and don’t stop.

These creatures don’t rule from parliaments.
They rule from shadows.
From bloodlines.
From vaults built on centuries of power—and centuries of control.

And while we argue over memes,
While we nitpick sound quality on a free podcast,
While we debate how orange our sunglasses should be—
They’re already building the next cage.

You want to know the core of the battle?

It’s this:
They built a system designed to enslave you.
And it works.
Because it’s not just code or money—it’s a mindset.
And they’ve trained you for generations to stay small. Stay busy. Stay broke.

They don’t care about trending topics, the fashion they make you wear, the rent seeking and mind numbing media garbage.
They don’t care about today’s startup scene.
They don’t need to.
They freeze technology until their factories are ready.
They script the narrative until their puppet politicians can sell it.
They control enough markets to play with your life like a cat with a mouse.

And no, they’re not thinking in 5-year business plans.
They’re thinking in bloodlines.
They’re thinking in centuries.

They are bloodsuckers.

They take the rights of the gifted,
Take the skills of the builders and make them into jesters
They crush the dreams of the brave,
weaken strong sons,
and turn bright daughters into obedient servants.
They make you lose time;
Steal your effort
Slap a price on anyone.

But here’s the good news:

We are Bitcoiners.
We don’t need their permission.
We don’t need to play their game.
We hold a sword they can’t lift — an indestructible blockchain.
And we have “forever coins”.
We have the heaviest hammer

We can build faster.
Stack hard money.
Deliver proof of work and become the
worst multi-generational pests they’ve ever seen.
And take everything from them in about four generations:

One generation to build and adapt.
One or two to take over,
and One glorious one to finish the job and chop their virtual heads off to end the corruption

Their heads on a stake, is the only proof-of-stake’ism that will be universally liked.

Because in their world, people are the fuel — drained for passive yield.
But in our world?

We, the Bitcoin people who underwrite its value, represent the negative yield on fiat.
We ARE your negative yield in human form


We are their weakness — if we become as relentless and evil as they are.
We can be methodical and calculated, generations of poison for their system
We infiltrate, poison, outpace them.
Like they did centuries ago with the commons, the tribes and kings.
As focused.
As strategic.
As ruthless.

Then—only then—can we clean ourselves.

Only then, with the deed done, can we rebuild humanity.
Burn the bloodlines that buried us.
The old bloodlines—those leeches—will be caged, stripped, and left to wither in poverty, and as history proves…
they never survive poverty
While we’ve been bathing in it by choice.

From their ashes, we’ll purge our own darkness
and thrive through innovation, not tyranny
We will work,
We will thrive through innovation, not colonization.
Through consensus, not decree.
Through quality not administrative control.
And talent and skills will rise on merit, not aristocratic last names.
We verify without grandeur.

In that world, our temples; they’ll exalt beauty
— not control.

In that world,
Their goons and servants will be our jesters,
dancing like harlots, their princesses will be sobbing on dirt,
they’ll all eat their own industrial drab

The power is already ours;
we don’t need to pray,
we don’t need hope nor luck.
We need raw,
unrelenting will.

We need power.

And evil, focused, unshakable determination.

You can’t slay monsters with flyers.
You don’t take down empires with stickers.
You don’t bring bloodlines to their knees with polite debates on their stages.
You slay monsters with the sharpest sword in history — Bitcoin.

They’re gutted with the sharpest blade—our blockchain—plunged into
their stone cold hearts, until their black blood flows over the marble floors of their castles and their next of kin.
Then, we feast and build anew on the ruins of their depravity.

Their next of kin witnessing our determination
while their funding falls dry in promises of continuity
they hide or perish.

Then we slay the rest.

We drink their blood, their wine, their milkshake.
We burn their paper promises and their repeating cycles of social unrest and greed.

We build something new.
Something real.

On the ruins of everything they corrupted.

Bitcoiners need to be more than just polite
Be more evil, to do more good.
Show monsters no mercy nor empathy.
Don’t give them hard money,
but wreck their legacy and their
faceless organizations and companies.

We are the debt collectors of last resort.
We are the negative yield that spins and twists.
We are the final rotation of the hamster wheel of your pointless waste of energy.
We save ourselves with math..

Bitcoiners,
Do thy proof of work,
or become a whore for their next generation of silver spoon fed monster kids
You’ll have to be polite doing the deeds if you do

Or take the smile off their face.
Sacrifice.
Work
Defy

Slay monsters like a knight building a legacy, freeing the world.

Or serve the monsters like the bitch you are.

Our consensus
and your choice.
